* What is 'runMode' ?
runMode is a system property which tells the program whether it needs to execute
against Pi or mock the Pi and run it locally.

* How is 'runMode' set?
runMode is set as a system property using the -DrunMode=mock command line 
argument to the JVM. If you want to apply it from within eclipse

  - Open Run -> Run Configuration
  - Choose the configuration of your program or JUnit driver
  - Go to arguments tab
  - In the VM arguments, put -DrunType=mock
  
* What are the possible values of 'runMode'?
If the value of runMode is "mock" (without quotes and ignore case), the program
will execute in a mock mode. Any other value will make it execute live against
Pi.
